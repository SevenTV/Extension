### Yeah but this is a third party thing and idk

7TV is a less opinionated emote extension for Twitch and Youtube, offering more creative freedom for emote artists and many extra features. This project was originally started as a personal work experience project, as a reaction to the unfair removal of certain emotes by the developers of other extensions but has since become a fully maintained service.

Currently this project is made up of 3 components

1. An API/Server to deliver service
1. A browser extension to view emotes
1. A [web app](https://7tv.app/) to manage emotes
