#### AVIF Support

<span style="font-size:larger;">
We are the first emote provider to support WEBP, and as we've inspired others to do the same, we're taking the initiative of supporting AVIF (AV1 Image File Format)!
AVIF is the image variant of the AV1 Video Codec, capable of shrinking image sizes from 20% to 90% over a GIF. 
</span>

AVIF will now be automatically served to users of Google Chrome 100+ (or chromium-based browsers).

#### Much more to come

<span style="font-size:larger;">This is just the beginning! We've rewritten the entire extension with a modular, scalable codebase just waiting to be expanded upon. Expect many new additions to come!</span>
