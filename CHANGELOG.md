#### New Emote Menu

<span style="font-size:larger;">The emote menu was completely redesigned, it's now divided into providers, emote sets, and even shows emojis! It also got smarter, only loading the images currently in view for much better performance.</span>

![Emote Menu](~/picture/cgl_display_emote_menu.avif)

#### New Settings Menu

<span style="font-size:larger;">7TV has just gotten much more customizable, check out the new menu and tune all the various settings to your liking!</span>

#### Dynamic Cosmetics

<span style="font-size:larger;">Badges, Paints & Animated Avatars will now update instantly. That's right, no more wait times!</span>

![Emote Carousel](~/picture/cgl_display_emote_carousel.avif)

#### AVIF Support

<span style="font-size:larger;">
We are the first emote provider to support WEBP, and as we've inspired others to do the same, we're taking the initiative of supporting AVIF (AV1 Image File Format)!
AVIF is the image variant of the AV1 Video Codec, capable of shrinking image sizes from 20% to 90% over a GIF. 
</span>

AVIF will now be automatically served to users of Google Chrome 100+ (or chromium-based browsers).

#### Much more to come

<span style="font-size:larger;">This is just the beginning! We've rewritten the entire extension with a modular, scalable codebase just waiting to be expanded upon. Expect many new additions to come!</span>
